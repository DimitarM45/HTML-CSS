            <h1>Quantum Computing</h1>
            <p>A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena.</p>
            <p>
                At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing
                leverages this behavior, specifically quantum superposition and entanglement, using specialized hardware
                that supports the preparation and manipulation of quantum states.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic
                communities.[2] Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain the waveâ€“particle duality
                observed at atomic scales,[3] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human
                computers for tedious calculations.[4] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II;
                computers played a major role in wartime cryptography,[5] and quantum physics was essential for the
                nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.[6]
